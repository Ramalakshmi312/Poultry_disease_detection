# Poultry_disease_detection
A Flask-based web application that uses a deep learning model to detect common poultry diseases â€” Coccidiosis, Newcastle, and Salmonella â€” from uploaded chicken images. Built with TensorFlow and Keras, the app allows users to upload images and receive real-time predictions along with confidence scores and disease management tips.
